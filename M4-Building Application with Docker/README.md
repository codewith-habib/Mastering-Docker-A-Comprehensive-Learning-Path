# Module 4: Building Applications with Docker

Welcome to **Module 4 of Docker In Simple!** This module focuses on building applications using Docker, covering topics like creating Docker images, deploying multi-container apps, and pushing images to registries.

---

## 📝 Module Overview

This module guides you through building and deploying real-world applications using Docker. You'll create a simple Express.js application, write a Dockerfile, build the Docker image, and push it to a registry like Docker Hub.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

- Develop a containerized Express.js application
- Write a Dockerfile to build a custom Docker image
- Properly tag and push Docker images to a registry
- Understand best practices for building Docker images
